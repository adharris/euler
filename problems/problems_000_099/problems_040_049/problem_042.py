    The _n_th term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, _tn_ =
    Â½_n_(_n_+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:
    
    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
    
    By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
    alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For
    example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = _t_10. If the word
    value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.
