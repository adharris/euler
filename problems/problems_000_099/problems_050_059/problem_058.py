    """Spiral primes.

    Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a
    square spiral with side length 7 is formed.
    
    **37** 36 35 34 33 32 **31**  
    38 **17** 16 15 14 **13** 30  
    39 18  **5** 4  **3** 12 29

    41 20  **7** 8 9 10 27  
    42 21 22 23 24 25 26  
    **43** 44 45 46 47 48 49
    
    It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right
    diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers
    lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
    
    If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square
    spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued,
    what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes
    along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
